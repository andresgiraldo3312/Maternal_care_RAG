# Reproducibility

1. Create an environment and install the required packages.

```bash
python -m venv RAG_guias
source RAG_guias/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. Install ollama and download LLM.

```bash
curl -fsSL https://ollama.com/install.sh | sh
ollama pull gemma2:2b
```

3. Execute the pipeline. When running local models, ensure that the system is equipped with a GPU offering adequate VRAM, as the memory requirements will vary depending on the size and architecture of the selected LLM. For cloud-based deployments, appropriate authentication credentials must be properly configured to enable model access.

```bash
python main.py Data/KNOWLEDGED_BASE/ Data/QUESTION/preguntas.xlsx Data/ANSWER/ Data/GROUND_TRUTH/ground_truth.xlsx config.yml
